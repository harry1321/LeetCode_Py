# Python Solutions & Notes for LeetCode

Iâ€™m currently following the roadmap provided by NeetCode to learn basic data structure and algorithms. This repository keeps the thought process solving LeetCode problems, while some are enlightened by the tutorials from NeetCode which I think are very clear and helpful. All problems I practiced are classified by ds. or algo. topics.
